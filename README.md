# Webshare Stremio Addon

<img src="src/static/logo.png" height="250px"/>

This addon enables streaming movies and series from Webshare.cz.

The main principles are simplicity and low-maintenance. For this reason there is no video catalog
which would provide high-quality content. This addon works by searching files directly on
webshare.cz. Note this may and does produce incorrect results, but you can usually quickly find the
correct streams.

Feel free to open up issues if you find any issues.

## How can I use it?

This addon is submitted to the community addon catalog. To install, just go Addons -> Community and search for `Webshare.cz`.

Alternative is to follow the link https://20317bf4c6c6-webshare-stremio-addon.baby-beamup.club/ and install from there.

You need to have valid Webshare.cz credentials and a premium account.

## Development
